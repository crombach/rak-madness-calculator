Never wrap a line yourself. GitHub turns each newline into a visible break.
One bullet is one line, however long.

Shortest body a reviewer can review from, under 256 words. Bullets, one line each,
not paragraphs. Every line must change how they read the diff. Cut every line that
does not, and delete every section left with nothing to say. A heading, an
attribution footer and an embedded screenshot or recording do not count against
the budget. Add one where seeing the change beats reading about it,
usually a UX change, not as a matter of course.

Never in the body: a retelling of the ticket, the path taken to the change,
alternatives rejected, counts of files or lines or tests, timings, coverage or
benchmark numbers nobody asked for, a tour of the code, or a note about your own
machine. A reviewer reads the diff and can click the ticket.

Write ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English, for Zinsser's simplicity, brevity,
clarity and humanity.

- Active voice, imperative for an instruction: "Run the test", not "The test should be run".
- Simple present or past tense. No perfect and no progressive.
- One idea per sentence, 20 words max. No clause-chains: split them.
- Cut every word that changes nothing for the reader. Simplicity, then brevity.
- Plain and direct, never stiff. Write for a person, not for a committee.
- No `-ing` form as a noun: "before you run it", not "before running it".
- Condition before action: "If the check fails, the run stops."
- Same word for the same thing every time. No synonym for variety.
- American English spellings: `color` not `colour`, `analyze` not `analyse`.
- Short common word: `use` not `utilize`, `fix` not `remediate`, `start` not `initiate`.
- Max three nouns in a row. Break a longer cluster with a preposition or a verb.
- Keep articles and relative pronouns. No slang, idiom, or metaphor. Technical names and code stay exact.
- No hedging unless the uncertainty is real.
- No em-dashes, no semicolons, no parenthetical asides, no antithesis, no aphorisms, no meta-commentary.

Leave no empty headings.

## What

<!-- One or two sentences: what changed and where. Link every ticket this belongs to (Jira, Linear) as a URL, the one in the title first. No ticket: link nothing. -->

## Why

<!-- The problem, one or two sentences. Skip if What covers it. -->

## Changes

<!--
One bullet per design decision a reviewer would otherwise reverse-engineer, plus anything deliberately out of scope.
One line each, six at most. Skip the mechanical ones.
-->

## Verification

<!-- Only checks CI can't show: a manual repro, a one-off check. One line each. Never the standard build, test, lint, or hooks. Else delete. -->

## Notes / Follow-ups

<!-- Only what a reviewer or merger would be wrong not to know: a gap this PR doesn't fix, merge ordering, a dependent PR. One line each. Else delete. -->
