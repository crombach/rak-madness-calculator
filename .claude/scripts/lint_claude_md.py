"""Plan and check a repository's bottom-up CLAUDE.md navigation tree.

One file on purpose: agentified repos vendor it into `.claude/scripts/` so their
`make lint-docs` and CI work with nothing installed, and a single file is a single
thing to re-copy when this one changes.

Subcommands:

  plan       <root>   JSON plan of the tree: every meaningful directory, deepest
                      first, with its direct files, its meaningful children, and
                      precomputed markdown link parts. Drives the writing step.
  structure  <root>   Findings where the tree does not match the plan.
  dupes      <root>   Findings where a parent link restates its child's summary.
  length     <root>   Findings where a file's own prose exceeds the word ceiling.
  check      <root>   structure, dupes, length, all three always run.
  count      <path>.. Words, headroom and the heaviest blocks. Takes files,
                      directories, or `-` to measure a draft on stdin before it
                      is written. Exit 1 when anything is over.

`<root>` defaults to ".". Exit 0 = clean, 1 = findings, 2 = could not run.

A directory is "meaningful" (gets its own CLAUDE.md) when it is the repo root,
directly contains 2+ files, contains a Claude-functionality marker file (a skill
`SKILL.md` etc., see CLAUDE_MARKER_FILES), or has at least one meaningful
descendant. The marker rule ensures a skill/hook/plugin directory is always
indexed even when it holds a single manifest file. This skips near-empty leaf
folders that would only add noise. Test and build-support directories (gradle
wrapper etc.) are excluded: only source, script, and documentation directories are
indexed. Pass-through directories (no direct files of their own, any number of
children, e.g. `skills/` or a Java/Kotlin package prefix) are collapsed: they get
no CLAUDE.md and parents link through them.

File scope comes from `git ls-files` when available, which respects .gitignore and
lists only tracked files. Otherwise it falls back to os.walk with a skip list.
