"""PreToolUse hook: nudge Claude to bring the CLAUDE.md search tree current before it ships.

Pairs with the agentify-docs skill. Fires on `git commit` and on `git push`, and
injects one reminder naming the CLAUDE.md files the new files affect.

Commit time, not edit time: a directory summary is only wrong once the work is
done, and one reminder per commit costs a fraction of one per edit. Push is the
backstop for commits this hook never saw, made by hand or by a script.

The two triggers read different sources. A commit is judged from the working tree
(staged additions plus untracked files), a push from the files the branch adds
over its upstream. Either way a directory is dropped once the same change touches
the CLAUDE.md that covers it, so a documented addition never nags.

Deliberately ignores in-place edits to existing files: rewriting a function body
rarely changes a one-line directory summary. The hook only detects. Claude judges
whether the summary actually needs to change and rewrites it.

Self-gating: silent when the command is neither, when cwd is not a git repo, when
nothing was added, or when no ancestor directory has a CLAUDE.md (tree never
built). Never decides the permission, so the command always proceeds. Any
unexpected error exits 0 silently so the hook never blocks a tool call.
