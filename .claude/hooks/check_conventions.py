"""PreToolUse hook: hold `git commit`, `gh pr create`, and `gh pr edit` to the repo's
commit and PR conventions. Runs inside Claude Code, so human contributors are
untouched.

Checks, all mechanical:
  - a commit subject and a PR title are held to one format, a Conventional Commit
  - either opens its summary with the branch's ticket key in brackets, when the
    branch names one
  - a PR body passed with --body/--body-file was built from the PR template,
    with no leftover guidance comments and no empty sections
  - the body links the ticket its branch names, when the template asks for it
  - the punctuation the template bans stays out of the body
  - the body stays inside the word budget the template states
  - a subject, a commit body and a PR body obey the Simplified Technical English
    rules the template turns on: the sentence cap, the short word, no -ing form
    used as a noun

Fails open everywhere: an unreadable subject or body (editor commits, `-F -`,
unbalanced quotes, a missing template) is allowed through. What it can read it
enforces, with no opt-out flag or environment variable. Don't add one.
